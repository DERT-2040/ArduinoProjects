ROBOT CAR INSTRUCTIONS

Install the arduino software before going through the guide from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
Choose the windows installer option, It is free but it will ask you if you want to contribute, click on just download.

1) Click on the green Clone or Download Button, then click Download ZIP.
2) Download the file and open it, then drag the contents of the folder on to your desktop or other file location.
3) Open the RobotCarPrograms folder
/*
 * Note between steps 3 and 4, we used two different types of ultra sonic sensors on the cars and it changes the
 * code you need to use. I will be updating this on 7/31/2018 with a better way to distinguish them, because I do
 * not currently have one with me. One way to distinguish them however, is if the ultra sonic sensor on the front of
 * your car has a tiny gray box between sound emitter/reciever on the front you use the RobotCarFinalProject Code.
 * If it does not have the tiny gray box you use the RobotCarFinalWithSensorV2 code.
 */
 
 4) If you have the tiny gray box on the ultra sonic sensor, go under the RobotCarFinalProject folder and double click
    on the .ino file
 5) If you do not have the tiny gray box on the ultra sonic sensor, go under the RobotCarFinalWithSensorV2 folder and
    double click on the .ino file
 6) If you have the arduino software install it should open, if not go to https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software and
    click on the Windows installer option to download it. Then try opening the file again.
 7) Plug the car into your computer with the Blue Usb cable you or your child recieved.
 8) With the Arduino software and the code open click on tools at the top, then under tools click on board and from
    the list choose Arduino Nano
 9) From tools again click on port and choose one of the options //Note come back to this step if uploading code first
    fails and select a different port, it is a bit of a guess and check game
 10) Click on the sideways arrow next to the checkmark to upload code to the car.
 
GitHub can be a pain to use and we will be updating the documentation here soon to make it better as well as creating
a google drive link to download and better instructions shortly.
